This package contains the robot model that is used by the realtime
controllers inside controller manager.

This robot model focuses on controlling the robot mechanism in a
realtime control loop, and therefore it only contains the components
of a robot that are relevant in realtime: the robot joints (with
encoders, transmisisons and actuators) and the kinematic/dynamic model
of the robot.
