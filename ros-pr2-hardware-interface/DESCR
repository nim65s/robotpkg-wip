This package contains the C++ interfaces to the PR2 hardware
components that are controlled over EtherCAT. This includes the
motors and encoders needed to control the PR2 mechanism, as well as
components like the pressure sensors in the fingertips, camera
triggers, etc... All of the hardware components in this interface
are directly available to the controllers inside the hard realtime
control loop.
